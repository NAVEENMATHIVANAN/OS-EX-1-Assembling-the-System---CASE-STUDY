# OS-EX-1-Assembling-the-System---CASE-STUDY
AIM:
To build the complete assembly of the Computer System

STEPS:
STEP 1: Open The Case
The First Step In Assembling A Computer Is To Open The Computer Case. To Open The Case, First Remove The Screws Of The Left Side Cover And Slide The Side Cover image

STEP 3: Attach The Components To Motherboard
The Motherboard Has To Be Prepared Before Its Installation. To Prepare The Motherboard, You First Need To Install The CPU, Then The Heat Sink On The CPU And CPU Fan. image
